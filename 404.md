Did your dream just flew away? I'm sorry, you seemed to kind of raised this error. What did you do? I don't know. Maybe you typed the wrong URL? This would be great, because then it isn't my fault and no one fires me. Well, if you got here by pressing anything in this documentary, please let me know so I can fix this. Either in the group you can find on the left. Or you make an issue on GitHub, that's cool too. You can write me directly as well, my name is down below. Somewhere.

I think I should write here that I'm sorry? Because you shouldn't even see this page? Well, I am if I disrupted your workflow. So, get back to our home page, and work again! Time is limited, your projects don't wait for you.


I love deadlines.
I love the whooshing noise they make as they go by...
